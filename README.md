# Linkdle

ðŸ”— https://rpretzels.github.io/linkdle/

A variant of the Mastermind-style game Word-Master from octokatherine
(https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/).

The Linkdle game features guessing the word that connects two
other shown words. For example, connect: ALONE - NEEDY - YEARN.

## Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.

The correct word starts with the last 1-3 characters of the 1st shown word,
and ends with 1-3 characters from the start of the 2nd word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
